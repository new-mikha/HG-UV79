# How-To's for Lanchonlh HG-UV79 radio

### Turning it on and off

Use the right knob at the top of the radio.

### How to switch the interface to English

Menu `18` - to get there, **on the keypad**, find the top-left button (green)
button, it is the Menu/OK button. Press it once, you'll see the actual menu.
Scroll to item 18 in the menu, click the same Menu/OK button to select the menu
item, you'll see language choices. Believe it or not, but `英⽂` is the one for
English, so select it, then press the same Menu/OK button again. Voila.

### Bandwidth setting

Navigate to Menu `04 WN`. There is this little setting, the default value for
which might make things a bit messy for your purposes - the Bandwidth setting,
with `NARR` and `WIDE` (the default) options. I found that if it is set
to `WIDE`, it's actually wide, and the handset can unlock the squelch when some
nearby frequency is used.

By "nearby" I mean something practically close, e.g. if you're on an Aussie CB
channel, a transmission on the next or prev one might unlock the squelch, and
you can hear the conversation there - which I found to be a bit crazy. So I'd
recommend changing it to Narrow (`NARR`).

## To be continued...

If you're stuck, see the original scanned manual in
the [main srepo](https://github.com/new-mikha/HG-UV79/blob/1f96ab0eec85dc48a5e18d666499689ae0f4e9de/original-manual-scan/LANCHONLH%20HG-UV79%20-%20manual%20-%20OCR%20by%20Adobe.pdf).
It's a scan of a manual in Chinese, but it's text-recognized - **YOU'D NEED TO
DOWNLOAD THE FILE FOR THAT. BECAUSE AS OF NOW, THE TEXT COPY-PASTE DOES NOT WORK
ON GITHUB, YOU NEED TO OPEN IT IN A PROPER ACROBAT READER**. So even though the
original manual is not in English, it's still possible to copy-paste parts of it
into Google Translate.
